# AVI2MP4
Convert every AVI file found in specified folder to MP4 file format. 

You will need ffmpeg in order to make this work.

How to use it:
Go into a terminal, and then type: 
python 'script_name' 'ffmpeg exe location' 'avi file path location'

The output will be in the same folder where the AVI file is found.
